This is handy when iterating over arrays, where the compiler already knows the length of the array. This is common in nearly all languages I've encountered.\n","\n","A while loop, however, can behave differently in various languages, but in general there's a simple rule to follow \"while something is true, continue to do this thing here...\" or, \"while something remains false, keep looping over and over until I say otherwise\", or even, \"while this variable here says some value, keep running this block over and over\". A good example is executing a simple block of code over and over, while some boolean remains true, until the block of code decides to set it to false, then the while loop will quit and your functional code will continue with its procedure.\n","\n","Yes, it's true, in many languages you could use a while loop to iterate over an array, but that's not generally considered good form. However in some languages like Perl, there's an exception... while loops are preferred when iterating over very large arrays, since a for/foreach loop will load the entire array into memory, where as a while loop will load each element one at a time and then send it to garbage collection once it's moved on to the next element."],"metadata":{"id":"CNJy2ubnYYit"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1) Write a python program to print \"hello world\"\n","print (\"hello world\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Qmf0oBlOeTvj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733564236004,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1771,"user":{"displayName":"AJAY GADEKAR","userId":"02039670715739446031"}},"outputId":"bd5cc7ff-ae1e-4184-c147-f0bebd1a699e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["hello world\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2) Write a python program that displays your name and age\n","name ,age = \"ajay\",24\n","print (name ,age )"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"KNMOJSEaexa0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733564546566,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1474,"user":{"displayName":"AJAY GADEKAR","userId":"02039670715739446031"}},"outputId":"7974e7f0-84f8-4c8c-e8fe-9902a3f443fc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["ajay 24\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#3) Write code to print all the  pre difined keywordsin python using keyword list\n","help (\"keywords\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"YrHiXBS8gk6D","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733655104179,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":371,"user":{"displayName":"AJAY GADEKAR","userId":"02039670715739446031"}},"outputId":"f4b53563-8b60-4503-8934-d7cb66048285"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","Here is a list of the Python keywords.
